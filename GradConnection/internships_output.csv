Internships take many forms",", ranging in duration from a few weeks to six-months or more. The length of the work placement depends on the organisation. Some internships may count for academic credit towards a relevant degree.

Most internship programs with medium-to-large local corporations are paid",", often calculated at a percentage based on their current stage in their tertiary education. Small-to medium businesses can also offer paid internships",", although perhaps not at the same rate. Large organisations may have a structured training and development internship program that guides the student as they complete their work experience. They may also involve a lot of &ldquo;menial&rdquo; work such as getting coffees and printing documents. Internships at SMEs tend to be less structured",", but may provide a student with the opportunity to &ldquo;pick up&rdquo; and learn from example the habits and practices of business owners",", managers and employees across all functions of the business",", to whom they perhaps would not have access if they were employed in a specific subsection of a larger company.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBusinesses aren&rsquo;t the only organisations to offer paid internships either.

For the switched-on student",", participation in an internship or vacation program is an important step along the career pathway. Some confusion exists as to the difference between an &ldquo;internship&rdquo; and a &ldquo;vacation program&rdquo;.

Internships take many forms",", ranging in duration from a few weeks to six-months or more. The length of the work placement depends on the organisation. Some internships may count for academic credit towards a relevant degree. For example",", in engineering",", students are required to complete work placement before they are allowed to graduate.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EInternships may be structured in a variety of ways:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPaid internship\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPaid internships are the most desirable for students",", not only because they financially reimburse them for their work",", but because they are linked to higher employment rates and higher graduate salaries than unpaid internships. Most internship programs with medium-to-large local corporations are paid",", often calculated at a percentage based on their current stage in their tertiary education. Small-to medium businesses can also offer paid internships",", although perhaps not at the same rate. Large organisations may have a structured training and development internship program that guides the student as they complete their work experience. They may also involve a lot of &ldquo;menial&rdquo; work such as getting coffees and printing documents. Internships at SMEs tend to be less structured",", but may provide a student with the opportunity to &ldquo;pick up&rdquo; and learn from example the habits and practices of business owners",", managers and employees across all functions of the business",", to whom they perhaps would not have access if they were employed in a specific subsection of a larger company.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBusinesses aren&rsquo;t the only organisations to offer paid internships either.

However many organisations",", particularly SMEs",", do not specify in the outset whether they offer internships. In these cases the student must be pro-active and contact the organisation (usually by email)",", respectfully asking whether they would ever consider offering an internship",", (detailing what interests them about the company",", and pitching what the student can offer them",", should they be accepted as an intern).
